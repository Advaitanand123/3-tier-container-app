# 3-tier-container-app
Introduction

Welcome to the presentation on the architecture, deployment strategy, and management of our multi-container application.


Application Architecture


Components

1. Frontend (React App)
	- User interface built with React.
	- Served by Node.js.
	- Replicated for scalability.
2. Backend (Node.js App)
	- Handles business logic and communicates with the database.
	- Utilizes Express.js for routing.
	- Can scale horizontally based on demand.
3. Database (MongoDB)
	- MongoDB used as the backend data store.
	- Ensures data persistence.
	- Can be scaled for performance.

Communication

- Frontend communicates with the Backend via RESTful API.
- Backend communicates with the MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval.

Deployment Strategy


Containerization

- Docker containers used for each component.
- Ensures consistency across environments.
- Facilitates easy scaling and deployment.

Orchestration with Kubernetes

- Kubernetes used for container orchestration.
- Ensures high availability, scalability, and ease of management.
- Allows automated scaling based on demand.

Deployment Process

1. Local Development:
	- Developers use Docker Compose for local development and testing.
	- Enables a consistent development environment.
2. Continuous Integration (CI):
	- CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) build and push Docker images to the registry.
	- Automated tests are run during this stage.
3. Continuous Deployment (CD):
	- Kubernetes manifests define the application's deployment in the cluster.
	- CD pipeline triggers deployments to staging and production clusters based on successful CI builds.

Rollback Strategy

- Kubernetes supports rolling updates and rollbacks.
- If an issue arises, a previous version of the application can be quickly restored.

Building and Deployment Instructions


Prerequisites

1. Development Environment:
	- Docker installed for local development.
	- Kubernetes cluster set up (e.g., Minikube, kind) for testing.
2. CI/CD Pipeline:
	- Set up a CI/CD pipeline with your preferred tool.
3. Monitor Deployment:
	- Use kubectl get pods, kubectl get services, and other Kubernetes commands to monitor the deployment status.

Managing the Application

- Regularly monitor logs, performance metrics, and application health.
- Use Kubernetes Dashboard or other monitoring tools for insights.
- Consider implementing auto-scaling based on demand.
- Keep the CI/CD pipeline optimized for efficiency and reliability.


1: Project Structure


Create a project directory with the following structure:

3-tier-container-app/

|-- frontend/ |

|-- Dockerfile |

|-- (React app files)

|-- backend/ |

|-- Dockerfile |

|-- (Node.js app files)

|-- docker-compose.yml
